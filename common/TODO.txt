Ensure that msg_num is kept upon pushing

Write parse_routing_message()
  Should be able to add permissions to endpoints in the routing table

Add in generic function to write a specific type of message to a system
  That message will be sent to whichever end systems are capable of
  parsing that specific type of message.
    Requires correct permissions/properties

Create separate push/get/remove_msg functions for elka_msg and elka_msg_ack
so that the two types can remain in the same buffers but be sent out
differently. For example, an elka_msg in PX4 app should be published
as elka_msg_s, while elka_msg_ack in PX4 app should be published as
elka_msg_ack_s.

Convert message sending/receiving to be threaded separately from main loop.
This will allow buffers to shrink in size if they become saturated. It also
means that the user doesn't have to decide which type of push/get/remove
message to call (elka_msg vs elka_msg_ack)

Figure out how to return message to sender of receiver can't be reached
in the attempted way.
  I.e. if a route has been deleted

Encrypt messages
